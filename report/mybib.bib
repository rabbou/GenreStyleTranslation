	Abstract = {We consider the problem of partitioning a set of m points in the n-dimensional Euclidean space into k clusters (usually m and n are variable, while k is fixed), so as to minimize the sum of squared distances between each point and its cluster center. This formulation is usually the objective of the k-means clustering algorithm (Kanungo et al. (2000)). We prove that this problem in NP-hard even for k = 2, and we consider a continuous relaxation of this discrete problem: find the k-dimensional subspace V that minimizes the sum of squared distances to V of the m points. This relaxation can be solved by computing the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of the m Ã—n matrix A that represents the m points; this solution can be used to get a 2-approximation algorithm for the original problem. We then argue that in fact the relaxation provides a generalized clustering which is useful in its own right.},

Under the assumption that human visual perception is highly adapted for extracting structural information from a scene, we introduce an alternative complementary framework for quality assessment based on the degradation of structural information. As a specific example of this concept, we develop a structural similarity index and demonstrate its promise through a set of intuitive examples, as well as comparison to both subjective ratings and state-of-the-art objective methods on a database of images compressed with JPEG and JPEG2000.
